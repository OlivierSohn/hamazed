The AHDSR envelope is like an <https://www.wikiaudio.org/adsr-envelope/ ADSR envelope>
, except that the signal can be hold after the attack:

   | a |h| d |           |r|
       ---                                      < 1

     .       -------------                      < s

   |                     |
   key is pressed        key is released

Attack, decay and release phases can be shaped using an 'Interpolation'.
