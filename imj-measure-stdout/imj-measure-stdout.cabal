version:             0.1.0.3
Category:            Console, Terminal
Synopsis:            An application to determine the maximum capacity of stdout buffer.
Description:         The program helps you determine the maximum capacity of your stdout buffer.
                     .

                     It was initially developped to diagnose screen tearing issues
                     in a terminal-based game I was developping, and more specifically, to see the
                     effect of the following action :
                     .

                     > hSetBuffering stdout $ BlockBuffering $ Just maxBound
                     .

                     Using this program, I found that, on my system, the previous call quadruples
                     stdout's capacity, from 2048 to 8192 bytes.
