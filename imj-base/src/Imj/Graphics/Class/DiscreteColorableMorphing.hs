{- | Like 'DiscreteMorphing', except the
'Drawable' constraint is replaced by a 'Colorable' constraint:

Morph between /drawn/ representations of 'Colorable'.

[Drawn representation of 'Colorable' x]
The visual result of IO drawing commands induced by a 'drawUsingColor' @x@ call.

Instances should statisfy the following constraints:

* A morphing between /drawn/ representations of A and B start at the /drawn/
representation of A and ends at the /drawn/ represntation of B:

\( \forall (\, from, to)\, \in v, \forall color \)

@
    d = distance from to
    drawMorphingUsingColor from to 0 color "is the same as" drawUsingColor from color
    drawMorphingUsingColor from to d color "is the same as" drawUsingColor to   color
@

* The morphing path is composed of strictly distinct /drawings/.
* The /drawings/, when seen in rapid succession, should visually produce a
/smooth/ transformation from the first to the last /drawing/.-}
