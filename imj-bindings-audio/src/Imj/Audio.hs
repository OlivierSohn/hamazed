      This module lets you play polyphonic, poly-instrumental music and sounds,
      in real time.

      Behind the scenes, it uses
      <https://github.com/OlivierSohn/cpp.audio/tree/master/include a custom C++ audio engine> through
      <https://github.com/OlivierSohn/hamazed/tree/master/imj-bindings-audio these bindings>.

      The produced audio signal will be written to your audio system through the
      cross-platform (Windows, OSX, Unix) <http://www.portaudio.com/ portaudio API>.

      * C++ objects representing instruments are automatically recycled,
      hence the RAM usage is proportional to the number of /active/ instruments at any given time.

      * The real-time audio thread is /not/ managed by the GHC runtime, so there will be
      /no/ audio pauses during GHC garbage collection.

      * In the C++ audio engine, we control thread priorities so that when taking the
      global audio lock, the thread that takes it has the realtime priority, to avoid priority inversion
      when the realtime audio thread waits for the lock. This means that on linux,
      you should ideally 'sudo' the command starting the program, so that
      the program has the necessary privileges to configure thread priorities.
      If you don't, a warning message will be logged in the console, and the program will run,
      but with less guarantees about audio "smoothness" because we can potentially have priority
      inversion effect.

      * In theory (it has not beed much tested yet) it should be safe to call
      functions in a concurent / multithreaded context, because the library
      underneath uses locks to protect accesses to shared data.
      * There is no restriction on the kind of thread (bounded / unbounded) you can call these functions from.
