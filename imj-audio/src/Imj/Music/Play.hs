When the note-on, note-off events come from the user, in real-time, use the 'play' function.

When the music events are known in advance, but you want ot control the pace at which
the music will be executed, use the notion of 'Score' with 'stepScore', 'stopScore'
or the notion of 'Voice' with 'stepVoice', 'stopVoice'.

When the music events are known in advance, and you want to play them at a fixed tempo,
use 'playAtTempo', 'playVoicesAtTempo'
