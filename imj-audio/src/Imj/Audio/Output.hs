The functions in this module use
<https://github.com/OlivierSohn/cpp.audio/tree/master/include a lockfree, C++17 audio-engine>
to create the audio signal and output it through the
<http://www.portaudio.com/ portaudio> library.

=== Audio thread isolation from GHC runtime

Eventhough during garbage collection, GHC pauses all threads, since
the real-time audio thread is /not/ managed by the GHC runtime, there is
/no/ audio pause during GHC garbage collection.

=== Memory usage

The RAM usage will be proportional to the count of different 'Instrument's
playing music at the same time.

=== Concurrency

All exported functions are thread-safe.

      === Design evolution, from lockfull to lockfree

      To synchronize accesses to shared data between
      the audio realtime thread and non realtime threads, a locking approach was first used.

      ==== Lockfull

      This approach, while being easy to implement and reason about, lead to
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion priority inversion> issues:
      sometimes, the realtime trhead would have to wait (a too-long time)
      for a non realtime thread to release the lock. This caused
      audio output buffer overflows, and audio glitches.

      ==== Lockfull + thread priority adjustment

      To fix priority inversion, we raised the priority of every thread
      that was aiting to acquire the lock, and lowered the priority of the thread
      once the lock was released. Eventhough this approach was theoretically sound,
      it has proven ineffective in practice (maybe because the priority change doesn't
      take effect immediately?) and was requiring the program to be run under sudo
      on Linux, to grant the rights to modify thread priorities.

      ==== Lockfree

      A second, successfull attempt was made to fix the priority inversion by
      removing the need to lock in the realtime thread:
      using lockfree datastructures and algorithms, we could synchronize access
      to shared data without ever locking (and without ever waiting in the realtime thread).

      Both modes (lockfull, lockfree) are available today via C++ template parametrization.
      The lockfree mode is the default, and recommended mode today, as it allows to smoothly
      output audio, even under contention.

      When compiling the package, you can revert to the old and unsafe lockfull mode
      by activating the 'Lock' flag.

      === Benchmarks

      When compiling the package with the 'LogTime' flag, the program will write in the console,
      every 1000 audio callback calls, the max and average durations of the audio callback.
